Teamwork: You did great! Always prepared, always did what you were supposed to and help each others. Your git commit history says the same.

Technical: Overall really good! Well structured and easy to follow. You could do with a bit fewer inline CSS-setStyles and a few more comments would not hurt.

Presentation: Good!

Group Grade: A
